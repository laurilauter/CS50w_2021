#Prioritizing stories
Managing priorities

Tracker lists stories in a projects Current and Backlog panels in priority order. Dragging a story to the top of your Backlog makes it the top priority (after the stories already in the Current iteration). You can change the priority of a story in the Current panel that is not yet accepted by dragging it within the Current panel. You can also change the priority of a story using the keyboard. Unstarted stories cannot be dragged above started stories, as its assumed that the most important stories are already being worked on. Drag stories from the Icebox to the desired location in the Backlog to prioritize them.

Accepted stories are displayed according to the date they were accepted. If you need to change the order of an accepted story, you can expand the story and click on the calendar icon to change the accepted date. Also, accepted stories remain in the iteration they were accepted in, and only move to the Done panel when that iteration is complete.

You can choose from a variety of ways to make priorities visible in Tracker. If you need to move many stories around in your Backlog or Icebox, cloning the panel to more easily drag them to a new position helps. Selecting multiple stories for dragging to a new location, or for updating via the bulk actions menu, can also save you time.

Stories within an Epic Stories panel are also listed in priority order. You can prioritize stories within an epic by dragging them directly within the Epic Stories panel, up into the Backlog section or down into the Icebox section. When you add a story to an epic by dragging it to the Epic Stories panel, you can drop it in the location you want to reflect its priority.

Use release markers to group related stories and clearly reflect their priority.
