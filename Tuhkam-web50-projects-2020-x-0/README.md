Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


Hi,



I tried to cover all the tasks required by this exercise, please find the explanation below.



- The website uses several different HTML pages:

index.html

photo.html

gym.html

fish.html

contact.html

Navigation is provided by the top navbar, there are also clickable images on the front page.



- The fish.html contains lists, gym.html contains a table. There are several images on the site.

- The website has a local stylesheet file stuff/css/mystyle.css, and another external stylesheet bootstrap.min.css.

- The local mystyle.css uses at least five css properties, at least five css selectors.

Among these #id selector and .class selector at least once each.

- The mystyle.css uses @media screen to change the body background color according to viewport width.

- The website uses Bootstrap 4 components on the "Say Hello" contact.html, in particular, the "Say Hello" button and alarm message.

- Bootstrap columns are used in grid mode in index.html.

- mystyle.scss uses variables for grey and white colors. SCSS nesting is used to select the color of ul and p tags in the .middle class,

this can be seen on all pages and the unordered list effect in the fish.html. SCSS inheritance can be seen on the alert messages

in the gym.html.

 

I hope I got it all covered.



Kind regards,

Lauri
